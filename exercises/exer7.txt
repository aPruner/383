Language Description #1: C++

Indicate which version of the language you're talking about: C++11, C++17 (or Java 9, 10 etc).
    C++11

Overall programming paradigm (imperative, functional, object oriented, logic programming, etc.)?
    C++ is classified to many as a "general-purpose programming language"
    which contains imperative, object-oriented, and generic programing features.

Compiled, interpreted, bytecode compiled, JIT compiled (for the most common tools: either GCC or Clang)?
    C++ is compiled most commonly with the GCC (g++) compiler which does not support JIT compilation. 
    However, Clang does provide Just-in-time compilation as well as support for bytecode representation.

Static or dynamic types. Static or dynamic binding?
    C++ is statically typed, but has limited support for dynamic type casting through the dynamic_cast keyword.
    Similarly for binding, C++ is mainly statically bound but can use dynamic binding using polymorphism.

Strong or weak typing?
    C++ is a fairly strongly typed language. It requires you to specify types of every variable you declare.

Manual memory management or garbage collected (and garbage collection algorithm)?
    C/C++ leaves all the memory management up to the programmer.

Has first-class functions? Has closures?
    C++ is able to pass functions as arguments to other functions (first-class) 
    and has closure support called lambdas in C++11.

What support for concurrent/parallel programming is available?
    C++ utilizes forks/joins to run programs in parallel/concurrently.

Language Description #2: Python

Indicate which version of the language you're talking about: C++11, C++17 (or Java 9, 10 etc).
    Python3.7

Overall programming paradigm (imperative, functional, object oriented, logic programming, etc.).
    Python includes imperative, object-oriented, functional and procedural paradigms.

Compiled, interpreted, bytecode compiled, JIT compiled (for the most common tools: either GCC or Clang).
    Python is an interpreted language.

Static or dynamic types. Static or dynamic binding.
    It features a dynamic typing system and also does not require to specify types (dynamically bound)

Strong or weak typing.
    Python is strongly typed even though the variables don't need to have declared types.
    The variables' types don't randomly change.

Manual memory management or garbage collected (and garbage collection algorithm).
    Python has an automatic memory management system called the Python Memory Manager
    which deals with dynamic storage management.

Has first-class functions? Has closures?
    First-class functions are implemented in Python, being able to pass a function into another function.
    Python uses closures to add a form of abstraction to the code. 
        It hides information about variable and reduces the use of global variables.

What support for concurrent/parallel programming is available?
    Python supports pooling with the multiprocessing module by creating a multithreaded environment.
