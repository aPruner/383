Exers are what I tried to remake from the Haskell problems. 
Many I couldn't figure out how to do in Scala yet, but I understand much of the Scala language from my research and practice. 

Demos in this folder are based off a tutorial online, some are variations of problems from there so I kept them in the folder as some sample code that I wrote. 

The report is also in this zip file as well as submitted separately.
